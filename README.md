# YouTube-HTML5-Button

Creates a button in your chrome(ium-based) browser which let's you switch around between the new (standard) HTML5 `<video>` and the old Flash player on YouTube. Initial state at the start of each session (i.e. when you restart your browser) is to use the new HTML5 player, because Flash should only be used as fallback due to security and performance issues. Also the HTML5 player enables High Framerate (60 FPS) Videos.  
The icon on the button lets you know which player is currently active by showing the logo of the respective technology used.
