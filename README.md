# YouTube-HTML5-Button

Creates a button in your chrome(ium-based) browser which let's you switch around between the new HTML5 <video> (standard) and the old Flash player on YouTube. Initial state at the start of each session is to use the new HTML5 player, as flash should only be used as fallback due to security and performance issues.  
The icon on the button lets you know which player is currently active.

## installation

 - download the latest version from https://github.com/HarHarLinks/YouTube-HTML5-Button/releases
 - if you downloaded the .crx archive, simply drag and drop it into your extension manager (e.g. chrome://extensions)
 - if you downloaded the source, unzip/tar it, switch your extension manager to "Developer mode" and "Load unpacked extension"
